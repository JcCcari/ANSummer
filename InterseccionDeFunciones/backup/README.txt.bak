This program find the intersection points of two functions.

1) Select two functions.
2) Click 'Get Intersection' Button.
3) Wait the program find the intersections.

Testing:
This cases are especials, normal cases are fine.

1) Case: There are no Intersections.
  f(x) = ln(x)
  g(x) = exp(x)

  NOTE: This bug is fixed.

2) Case: There are greather than one intersection.
  f(x) = sin(x)
  g(x) = cos(x)

  NOTE: This case is done.

3) First Especial Case
  f(x) = 10
  g(x) = tan(x)

  NOTE: For some reason, this example generates points out of range initial ( Min, Max in Form1 )
        but this bug is fixed.

4) In Continuous Testing ...
